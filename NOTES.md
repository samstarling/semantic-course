h1. URIs
* Should be human-readable, with a natural hierarchy
** But this tends to be anglo-centric
* Should be stable (don't change when tech changes)
** But Wikipedia had an iPhone page before the Apple iPhone! (Linksys product)
** URI stayed the same, but actual 'thing' changed
** dbpedia suffers as a result of this
** But Wikipedia's database has an internal ID (which stayed the same when this happened)
